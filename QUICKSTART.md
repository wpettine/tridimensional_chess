## Movement Rules Quick Reference

### Standard Pieces in 3D
- **Pawn**: Forward 1-2 squares (first move), diagonal capture, can move between levels
- **Knight**: L-shape (2+1), can jump between levels
- **Bishop**: Diagonals, can change levels at any diagonal square
- **Rook**: Straight lines, can change levels along path
- **Queen**: Combines rook + bishop movement
- **King**: One square any direction, including to adjacent levels

### 3D-Specific Rules
1. **Vertical Column Blocking**: A piece blocks its (file, rank) column on ALL levels
2. **No Pure Vertical Moves**: Must move horizontally to change levels
3. **Knights Ignore Blocking**: Can jump over any piece and between levels

### Special Moves
- **En Passant**: Works across levels
- **Pawn Promotion**: When reaching furthest rank (varies by file)
- **Castling**: Not yet implemented (coming soon)

## Tips for New Players

### Camera Management
1. Start by rotating to get familiar with 3D layout
2. Zoom in to see piece details
3. Pan to focus on different board sections
4. Reset view by refreshing page if lost

### Strategy
1. Control the center (Neutral board)
2. Watch for vertical column blocks
3. Knights are powerful - they ignore blocking
4. Attack boards create unique tactical opportunities

### Common Mistakes
1. ‚ùå Forgetting vertical blocking rules
2. ‚ùå Trying to move straight up/down
3. ‚ùå Not checking all levels for threats
4. ‚ùå Ignoring attack board positions
